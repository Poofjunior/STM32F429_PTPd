# STM32F429 PTPd
---
this project is based on the STM32F429 Apollo development board and is improved from the stm32_f4_ptpd project. The open source project address is: https://github.com/mpthompson/stm32_f4_ptpd

## 1. Features
+ 
This project improves the PTPd filter of the original project, reduces the synchronization error, and speeds up the convergence speed. Under 180MHz main frequency, only need 3~4 cycles, can reach the synchronization error within 10ns.
+ This project uses FreeRTOS operating system directly generated by STM32 Cube. With the LwIP protocol stack, the underlying library is the HAL library, and the ETH module PTP related functions that are not in the HAL library are manually added

## 2. Instructions
Burn the Master and Slave to two different development boards, and then connect them directly with a network cable. It should be noted that the reset signal of the physical layer chip in this project is issued by PA5, which is directly connected to the reset pin of the physical layer chip through a flying line. This method can be used if the physical layer cannot be reset.
